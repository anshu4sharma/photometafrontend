          <h2 className="  smalltext tital1 text-light">1. Inherent Risks</h2>
          <div className="  smalltext  text-light">
            By accessing or using our Platform, you are voluntarily choosing to
            engage in sophisticated and risky asset transactions. You are
            further acknowledging that you are aware of the inherent risks
            associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems
            including, but not limited to, risks of financial loss, technology
            glitches and hacking. We work hard to provide state-of-the-art
            systems and security. Nonetheless, certain issues and risks are
            unavoidable, and if such issues or problems arise in connection with
            your use of our Platform, including technical difficulties with
            depositing or trading Crypto assets, it may take days, weeks, or
            months to resolve, and some issues may not be resolved at all.

          <h2 className="  smalltext tital1 text-light">2. Market Risks</h2>
          <div className="  smalltext  text-light">
            The markets for Crypto assets are highly volatile due to factors
            including but not limited to, adoption, technology, security, and
            regulation. Crypto assets trading is subject to high market risk and
            price volatility. Changes in value may be significant and may occur
            rapidly and without warning. Past performance is not a reliable
            indicator of future performance.

          <h2 className="  smalltext tital1 text-light">3. Cryptocurrency Risks</h2>
          <div className="  smalltext  text-light">
            Crypto assets may incur a number of intrinsic risks, and are
            commonly associated with criminal activities, including, but not
            limited to; i. distributed denial of service; ii. sybil attacks;
            iii. phishing; iv. social engineering; v. hacking; vi. smurfing;
            vii. malware; viii. double spending; ix. majority-mining, consensus-
            based or other mining attacks; x. misinformation campaigns; xi.
            forks; and xii. Spoofing. Furthermore, Crypto assets
            risks include cyber risks, such as hacking for ransom
            payments, layering, etc. Therefore, you may do your own homework and
            research before you use our Platform and you agree and acknowledge
            that PMC will not be responsible for any of such losses you may
            face. The Crypto assets may lose some or all of their value while
            they are supplied and you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of
            prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool, and,
            especially in expert modes, experience significant price slippage
            and cost. You shall understand that anyone can create a token,
            including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely
            claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk
            that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens.

            AGREEMENT. 
            <br />
            3. RISK DISCLOSURES 
            <br />
            1. PMC expressly disclaims all representations or warranties of any
            kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise about the
            Platform and Services, including, without limitation, any implied
            warranties of merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose,
            non-infringement or course of performance. The PMC is only liable
            for damage other than injury to life, limb or health and/or if the
            damage results from intentional or grossly negligent acts or a
            culpable violation of essential contractual obligations (e.g., the
            payment of bonuses), or damages resulting from the breach of
            obligations in contract negotiations as well as in the event of
            torts by the PMC, its employees or agents. Any further liability for
            damages is excluded for PMC. 
            <br />
            2. Further PMC, its employees or agents, is limited to those damages
            that may be typically foreseeable at the time of conclusion of this
            agreement based on the Terms and also to the average amounts as
            would be typical for contracts of this sort. This also applies to
            indirect damages, including, in particular, loss of profits. We
            disclaim any liability for damage of any kind caused by data losses
            on computer servers, unless such losses are caused by gross
            negligence or intentional actions of the PMC, its employees or
            agents. The Platform treats any content stored on the servers by
            IPMO as third-party content in accordance with all relevant and
            applicable data protection legislation. The PMC shall not be liable
            for any wrong data and/or information submitted by the IPMO in the
            application and shall not be responsible if incorrect usernames have
            been provided by IPMO. 
            <br />
            3. PMC shall not be responsible for any of its IPMO’s claims about
            income, team building or others. The PMC has a ZERO tolerance when
            it comes to unprofessional behavior that can in any way shape or
            form its business reputation. If an IPMO encounters unprofessional
            behavior he/she must immediately notify us. In addition, we shall
            not be responsible for the loss of the tokens given to the customer
            and also shall not be responsible for any hacking in the account of
            IPMO or in the event of any third person abusing the account. 
            <br />
            4. We shall not be held responsible for or control that which may be
            considered illegal online activities. For example, an illegal
            activity could be asking for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies or
            bank transfers in other currencies in exchange for PM units with a
            discounted price and then, in neither case, conclude the exchange.
            The PMC management team is committed to countering and blocking
            illegal actions as much as possible. We cannot control activities on
            the whole IoT: transactions are sometimes done on the Platform and
            sometimes takes place via private chat and in public on messaging
            channels. For this reason, we request the IPMO or hypothetical PMC
            users to always refer to our Platform and its internal support
            communication channel or via email, at info@photometa.club. IPMO is
            requested to be vigilant if he/she decides to do independent
            peer-to-peer trading with unknown people. 
            <br />
            5. The Platform displays certain products of unaffiliated
            third-party vendors. Therefore, certain features of the Platform and
            products may utilize the services and/or products of third-party
            vendors and business partners. Certain of these vendors and business
            partners require users who utilize such features to agree to their
            additional terms and conditions. This term identifies that IPMO uses
            of such products or services constitute IPMO’s agreement to be bound
            by these additional terms of use. These third parties’ terms are
            subject to change at such third parties’ The PMC shall not be
            responsible and does not assume any liability whatsoever for acts,
            errors, defaults or omissions of any third-party services and
            products.  
            <br />
            6. The value of the PM token is determined by clients of the
            Service. There are no predictions about its value and it is not a
            tool for speculating. IPMO acknowledges and agrees that PMC is not
            an investment or a financial institution and therefore, any profit
            from it cannot be guaranteed. There are no purchase obligations for
            IPMO and nor promises of returns. Rewards are given if there is an
            activity within the ecosystem and from the referral program. The
            fees are generated only when the products are used and transactions
            are performed. 
            <br />
            7. IPMO shall take on the risks that are associated with utilizing
            an Internet based crypto system including, but not limited to,
            hardware and software sudden malfunctions, and internet connections
            issues, therefore IPMO acknowledges that we do not warrant that (i)
            the Platform will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any
