            and cannot be held liable for any advertising materials disseminated
            by the IPMO and any established violations of the ethical rules
            stipulated in these Terms and all other legally related official
            documents, shall be subject of sanctions, including immediate

            PMC, by providing a written notice within seven (7) days from the
            date of submission of the application. The deadline is considered
            met if the notice has been sent by the deadlines, as evidenced by
            the date of the ticket or email.
            <br />
            25.3. In certain circumstances, both parties may terminate the
            agreement at any time, with one (1) month prior written notice. The
            cancelation or termination shall be sent to the customer service via
            ticket on the support portal or via support email
            info@photometa.club
            <br />
            25.4. This contract between IPMO and us shall be canceled only if
            there are no any membership purchased and there are no any
            activities recorded as transactions. The PMC Global reserves the
            right to not refund IPMO for Training Packages/Events of its
            proprietary information that IPMO has already used or participated
            in.
            <br />
            25.5. In the event of breach of any of these Terms stipulated herein
            and/or if the IPMO fails to remedy the same in a timely manner as
            set forth in these Terms, or terminate if the IPMO breaches any
            applicable statutory law, in such circumstances, PMC shall be
            entitled to terminate IPMO’s account in the Platform at any time,
            without the prior notice.
            <br />
            25.6. Further both parties to these Terms acknowledge and agree that
            either party shall be entitled to extraordinary termination of this
            agreement, if insolvency proceedings are instituted against the
            other party or if such proceedings were rejected due to a lack of
            assets or if the other party is otherwise insolvent or has submitted
            an affidavit of insolvency in response to an attempt to enforce a
            judgment by writ. The right to extraordinary termination shall not
            affect any other claims.
            <br />
            25.7. As a consequence of the termination of this agreement based on
            these Terms, IPMO is strictly prohibited to use the name of the PMC,
            or any other brand, business name, Service or product name owned by
            us or our business partners. Such an act shall impose legal
            liability towards IPMO. In addition, IPMO shall have no rights to
            rewards and especially to sales agent indemnification rewards
            claims.
            <br />
            25.8. An early termination of this agreement based on these Terms
            with a minimum period does not entitle the IPMO to any refund of any
            rewards, unless the IPMO has exercised the right to extraordinary
            termination due to an important reason.
            <br />
            25.9. IPMO may request for a cancellation of the PMC account, IPMO
            shall provide us with a written confirmation as to the reason for
            cancellation.
            <br />
            25.10. In addition, IPMO shall be required to send a photo of
            him/herself holding the identity document which has been submitted
            in the initial KYC process along with the cancellation request.
            <br />
            25.11. In the event of cancellation/termination of the account, any
            benefits, rewards, and/or Services received by either party must be
            returned according to the refund and cancellation policy.
            <br />
            25.12. Please note that once we proceed with the cancellation
            request, IPMO will not be able to login again and will not be able
            to redeem the amount left in the PMC account. IPMO’s account will be
            permanently terminated and any amount left in the account shall not
            be redeemable. It is IPMO’s responsibility to redeem the amount
            before the cancellation/termination of the account.
            <br />
            25.13. In any event, if IPMO is unable to return the Services
            received either in full or in part, or can only return them in a
            condition worse than that in which they were received, the IPMO must
            reimburse for the loss in value. All rewards refunds must be made
            within thirty (30) days, which shall begin from the date the IPMO
            sends his/her cancellation notice to PMC.
            <br />
            25.14. An IPMO may re-register with PMC, provided that said
            cancellation was more than twelve (12) months earlier and that the
            IPMO has not since performed any activities for our Platform in the
            interim.
            <br />
            25.15. In the event that a married couple or life partners, a legal
            entity or partnership registered as IPMOs terminate their
            association internally, there shall still be only one IPMO position
            even after the separation, dissolution or other termination of the
            above-mentioned association. Those members/shareholders leaving the
            legal entity or partnership shall decide internally which
            member(s)/shareholder(s) shall continue this agreement based on
            these Terms and provide written notice of their decision to us. In
            the event of an internal dispute over the consequences of the
            separation, divorce, dissolution or other termination with respect
            to the participation in the Platform, we reserve the right of
            extraordinary termination, where such a dispute leads to a
            dereliction of the IPMO’s duties, to a violation of these Terms, to
            a violation of the applicable laws or to an unreasonable burden on
            the downline or upline.

          </h2>
          <div>
            26.1. The IPMO can return the PMC products purchased in the
            following circumstances (excluding customized or personalized
            items):
            <br />
            26.1.1. The MULTISERVICES membership purchased can be reimbursed to
            the IPMO in the event that it has not logged in for a period of
            fourteen (14) days from the date the membership is purchased, unless
            there is a mandatory term, established by law applicable. No refunds
            will be made after the IPMO has logged into the account and also
            transferred a 0.00000001 PM, or received at least one cash back, or
            watched a video of the course provided in the Platform, or use the
            any service included in the MULTISERVICES. By logging into the PMC
            account, it is considered that the IPMO is accepting these Terms and
            that no refunds are made for the rewards.
            <br />
            26.1.2. The IPMO has the right to terminate his/her business
            relations with us and to withdraw from this agreement based on these
            Terms, only if IPMO has not logged into the account, and not started
            using the Platform or obtained access to the products. In such
            circumstances PMC will process the return immediately after
            verifying that the IPMO is entitled to a refund.
            <br />
            26.1.3. Please note that the IPMO may expect to receive
            reimbursement within thirty (30) working days of receiving the
            notification of termination by PMC. IPMO acknowledges and agrees
            that PMC&#39;s return policy WILL NOT cover situations in which the
            IPMO has already received rewards, or other benefits, as a result of
            the use of PMC products and/or Services. The reimbursement will be
            made entirely on PMC (PMC).
            <br />
             26.2. Please note, this Refund policy will not be applicable for
            any “Services” provided by the Platform and by accessing the
            Platform IPMO agrees and acknowledges that the PMC will not
            reimburse any product if the IPMO has used the product.
            <br />
            26.3. All refund requests must be made within14 days of submission
            of the application. The return request will deactivate the initial
            order instructions and it will delete the IPMO’s unique
            identification (user name) for the Training and Rewards Package.
            This policy is designed to protect the ALS training and education
            material because it is proprietary intellectual property. The IPMO’s
            activation and position in the Referral Plan will be canceled. Any
            rewards paid to returnees will be deducted from the refund amount.
            <br />
            26.4. The PMC will process the return promptly upon verifying that
            the IPMO is eligible for a refund. In most cases, the IPMO should
            expect to receive the refund within 120 working days of receipt of
            the products by the PMC. The IPMO hereby confirms that he/she
            understands that our return policy WILL NOT cover situations where
            the IPMO has already received commission payouts, or other benefits,
            as a result of using the PMC products and/or Services.
            <br />
            26.5. Requests for refund or cancellation shall be sent to us via
            email to info@photometa.club and IPMO shall provide his/her

            PARTIES AND/OR DEATH OF THE CLIENT <br />
            27.1. In the event of IPMO’s death, who is a natural person;
            <br />
            27.1.1. The contractual relationship between PMC shall come to an
            end. In certain circumstances, by receiving a legal document
            confirming IPMO’s death or any information leading us to believe
            that IPMO has died, we will temporarily suspend such IPMO’s account.
            Upon receiving the legal document such as death certificate, probate
            document, or letter of administration or a valid Will or similar
            testamentary document of the deceased IPMO, PMC shall grant access
            to the lawful heir or designated fiduciary that will continue the
            business covered by these Terms. As a rule, the heir or the
            designated fiduciary must sign a new agreement within six (6) months
            of the previous IPMO’s death with PMC. This six (6) month period may
            be extended by a reasonable length of time on an exceptional basis,
            if it is disproportionately short for the heir(s).
            <br />
            27.1.2. The above-mentioned business is aimed to facilitate the
            provision of the services, including rewards, technical and
            administrative operations of the PMC. Those businesses are
            independent separate entities, where the relevant to their place of
            registration laws shall be applied. The PMC is not and shall not be
            held liable for any activities of those partnering businesses,
            unless any occasional violations of the relevant and applicable
            legislations are caused by gross negligence or intentional actions
            of the PMC, its employees or agents/partnering business.
            <br />
            27.1.3. If we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that
            there is uncertainty regarding the validity of the fiduciary
            designation, we reserve the right to require an order resolving such
            issue from a court of competent jurisdiction before taking any
            action relating to the deceased IPMO’s account.
            <br />
            27.2. The IPMO is entitled to transfer his/her downline
            structure/position only with the prior written consent of the PMC,
            which is to be given at its sole discretion and presentation of the
            purchase and/or transfer the contract with the third party, as well
            as the presentation of the IPMO application of the third party to
            the PMC. IPMO shall be obliged to notify of the intended transfer of
            his/her sales structure in writing. IPMO’s sales structure is only
            permitted, if the business relationship between the IPMO and us has
            not yet been terminated. In the event of immediate termination or
            breach of these Terms, the right of the IPMO to sell his/her own
            sales organization is withheld; similarly, the right to sell is
            withheld in the event the respective IPMO has outstanding rewards to
            us.
            <br />
            27.3. In the event if an IPMO who is a legal entity or partnership
            is newly registered and wants to add a new shareholder, it shall be
            possible if the previous shareholder(s) who filed the original
            application remain as shareholders. In any circumstances, if a
            shareholder wishes to leave a legal entity or partnership which is
            registered as an IPMO or if the shareholder wishes to transfer
            his/her stake amounting to more than 30% to third parties, such an
            action shall be approved by us with the prior written consent,
            including copies of the corresponding notarial deeds.
            <br />
            27.4. An IPMO who is registered as a natural person wishes to
            transfer his/her position to a legal entity or partnership, it shall
            be possible with the prior consent of us, solely at our own
            discretion, provided that the IPMO agrees to continue to be solely
            responsible and personally liable to us and submits the relevant
            documents. In such cases we may levy an administrative fee of €500
            to process such requests. If this requirement is not met, then we
            reserve the right to extraordinary termination of this agreement
            based on these Terms.

          <div className="  text-light smalltext  text-light">
            28.1. Upon the death of an IPMO, the rights and responsibilities of
            the IPMO are passed on to the rightful heir(s) as determined by a
            court of competent jurisdiction. The heir(s) must also confirm in
            writing to change the status of the IPMO within 6 months from the
            previous IPMO’s death. <br />
            28.2. Upon divorce, IPMO shall notify as to which former spouse will
            assume ownership of the IPMO position as determined by a court of
            competent jurisdiction. A change in the ownership of the IPMO’s
            position will not take place until the PMC receives a copy of the
            divorce documentation. The party who does not assume ownership of
            the IPMO’s position desires to remain an IPMO; he/she may do so by
            submitting a new IPMO application at the time the divorce
            documentation is submitted to us. Such IPMO shall then be entered as
            a new IPMO in accordance with the enrolment policy of us.
            <br />
            28.3. Upon marriage, if two (2) existing IPMOs marry, each IPMO
            shall maintain his/her IPMO’s position separately.
            <br />
            28.4. Upon the dissolution of a corporation or termination of a
            partnership, which owns the IPMO’s position, the ownership of the
            IPMO position will be transferred pursuant to this agreement based
            on these Terms, among the shareholders or partners or upon order of
            a court of competent jurisdiction upon written notification to us.
            If one or more of the partners or shareholders in an IPMO position
            terminates his/her on-going relationship with us by leaving the
            partnership or disposing of his/her share of equity holdings, such
            parties, including the departing party, shall continue to be bound
            by these Terms. If a dispute arises over the disposition of the
            partnership interest, or assets, or shareholdings or corporate
            assets, or the income from the IPMO position, the PMC may suspend
            the IPMO position and holds all rewards until the dispute over the
            disposition is resolved by agreement between the parties or by an
            order from a court of competent jurisdiction.

            28.5. Sale of an IPMO’s position or any rights, direct or indirect,
            relating to an IPMO position may not be transferred by the IPMO
            without prior written approval from the PMC. No sale will be
            approved unless it includes a covenant by the seller not to solicit
            his/her prior group of IPMOs for at least six (6) months after the
            effective date of the sale. An IPMO position or any right thereto
            which is under suspension, on probation, or subject to any
            disciplinary action or any investigation by or on behalf of the PMC,
            may not be sold or otherwise transferred while such condition
            continues.
            <br />
            28.6. Withdrawal or Removal of Co-IPMOs, Partners and/or Owners. If
            a Co-IPMO, Partner or Owner is removed or withdrawn from the IPMO
            position, the remaining IPMO position shall be responsible for all
            acts or omissions in contravention of this agreement based on these
            Terms of those who have left the IPMO position, for a period of six
            (6) months after the date of the departure of the Co-IPMO, Partner,
            or Owner for purposes of this provision, the seller will be required
            to continue to comply with all terms post-termination obligations of
            this agreement based on these Terms.

            28.7. Name Change - An IPMO may change the operating name of the
            IPMO position by forwarding the written notification to us. We
            reserve the right to request the articles of incorporation or
            partnership agreement of a partnership, or any amendments pertaining
            thereto, as well as any other relevant documents or corporate or
            partnership documentation relating to ownership or control.
            <br />
            28.8. Change of the enrolling IPMO - IPMOs wishing to change their
            registering IPMO can do so only by resigning and then waiting one
            (1) year before reregistering with a different IPMO. Except as set
            forth in this clause, changing the enrolling IPMO is not allowed.
            The IPMO commission opportunity is a business built upon sales of
            products for consumption and upon the creation of relationships.
            Once a new IPMO is referred or enrolled, the Platform will protect
            this relationship to the fullest extent possible.
            <br />
            28.9. Suspension of Rewards- If there is any question over the
            disposition of the IPMO position or the income from the IPMO
            position, the PMC shall suspend the IPMO and hold all rewards until
            the dispute over the disposition is resolved by agreement between
            the parties or by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.

             32. RISK DISCLOSURES
          </h2>
          <div>
            32.1. PMC expressly disclaims all representations or warranties of
            any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise about the
            Platform and Services, including, without limitation, any implied
            warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
            non- infringement or course of performance. The PMC is only liable
            for damage other than injury to life, limb or health and/or if the
            damage results from intentional or grossly negligent acts or a
            culpable violation of essential contractual obligations (e.g., the
            rewards), or damages resulting from the breach of obligations in
            contract negotiations as well as in the event of torts by the PMC,
            its employees or agents. Any further liability for damages is
            excluded for PMC.
            <br />
            32.2. Further PMC, its employees or agents, is limited to those
            damages that may be typically foreseeable at the time of conclusion
            of this agreement based on the Terms and also to the average amounts
            as would be typical for contracts of this sort. This also applies to
            indirect damages, including, in particular, loss of profits. We
            disclaim any liability for damage of any kind caused by data losses
            on computer servers, unless such losses are caused by gross
            negligence or intentional actions of the PMC, its employees or
            agents. The Platform treats any content stored on the servers by
            IPMO as third-party content in accordance with all relevant and
            applicable data protection legislation. The PMC shall not be liable
            for any wrong data and/or information submitted by the IPMO in the
            application and shall not be responsible if incorrect usernames have
            been provided by IPMO.
            <br />
            32.3. PMC shall not be responsible for any of its IPMO’s claims
            about income, team building or others. The PMC has a ZERO tolerance
            when it comes to unprofessional behavior that can in any way shape
            or form its business reputation. If an IPMO encounters
            unprofessional behavior he/she must immediately notify us. In
            addition, we shall not be responsible for the loss of the tokens
            given to the customer and also shall not be responsible for any
            hacking in the account of IPMO or in the event of any third person
            abusing the account.
            <br />
            32.4. We shall not be held responsible for or control that which may
            be considered illegal online activities. For example, an illegal
            activity could be asking for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies or
            bank transfers in other currencies in exchange for PMC units with a
            discounted price and then, in neither case, conclude the exchange.
            The PMC management team is committed to countering and blocking
            illegal actions as much as possible. We cannot control activities on
            the whole IoT: transactions are sometimes done on the Platform and
            sometimes takes place via private chat and in public on messaging
            channels. For this reason, we request the IPMO or hypothetical PMC
            users to always refer to our Platform and its internal support
            communication channel or via email, info@photometa.club IPMO is
            requested to be vigilant if he/she decides to do independent
            peer-to-peer trading with unknown people.
            <br />
            32.5. The Platform displays certain products of unaffiliated
            third-party vendors. Therefore, certain features of the Platform and
            products may utilize the services and/or products of third-party
            vendors and business partners. Certain of these vendors and business
            partners require users who utilize such features to agree to their
            additional terms and conditions. This term identifies that IPMO uses
            of such products or services constitute IPMO’s agreement to be bound
            by these additional terms of use. These third parties’ terms are
            subject to change at such third parties’ discretion. The PMC shall
            not be responsible and does not assume any liability whatsoever for
            acts, errors, defaults or omissions of any third- party services and
            products.
            <br />
            32.6. The value of the PMC token is determined by clients of the
            Service. There are no predictions about its value and it is not a
            tool for speculating. IPMO acknowledges and agrees that PMC is not
            an investment or a financial institution and therefore, any profit
            from it cannot be guaranteed. There are no purchase obligations for
            IPMO and nor promises of returns. Rewards are given if there is an
            activity within the ecosystem and from the referral program. The
            fees are generated only when the products are used and transactions
            are performed.
            <br />
            32.7. IPMO shall take on the risks that are associated with
            utilizing an Internet based crypto system including, but not limited
            to, hardware and software sudden malfunctions, and internet
            connections issues, therefore IPMO acknowledges that we do not
            warrant that (i) the Platform will function uninterrupted, secure or
            available at any particular time or location, or will be error-free
            or free of harmful components; (ii) any errors or defects will be
            corrected; (iii) the Platform is free of viruses or other harmful
            components; (iv) any content and data, including your data, will be
            secure or not otherwise lost or damaged; (v) the results that may be
            obtained from the use of the Services will be accurate or reliable;
            or (vi) the results of using the Platform will meet your
            requirements or expectations.
            <br />
            32.8. In addition, IPMO further acknowledges that information IPMO
            store or transfer through Services may become irretrievably lost or
            corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes,
            including software failures, protocol changes by third parties,
            internet outages, force majeure event or other disasters including
            third party distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks, scheduled
            or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or outside
            our control. IPMO is solely responsible for backing up and
            maintaining duplicate copies of any information he/she stores or
            transfers through our Services. THEREFORE, NEITHER PMC, NOR ANY OF
            ITS EMPLOYEES, SERVICE PROVIDERS, AFFILIATES OR PARTNERS PROMISE OR
            PROVIDE A GUARANTEE THAT ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND SERVICES WILL BE
            PROVIDED COMPLETELY WITHOUT ERRORS OR OTHER MALFUNCTIONS THAT CAN BE
            CAUSED BY UNPREDICTED TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OR FAILURE FROM THIRD PARTY
            TO PROVIDE THE PROMISED SERVICE
