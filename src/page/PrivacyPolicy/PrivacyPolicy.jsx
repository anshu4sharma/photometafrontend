              PRIVACY TERMS IN USING CRYPTOASSETS AND BLOCKCHAIN
            </h2>
            <div className="text-light smalltext">
              The cryptoassets transactions are recorded on a public blockchain.
              It is a ledger which means a chain of blocks where each block
              contains the recording of any data transmission. Blockchains are
              decentralized or third-party networks which are not controlled or
              operated by any third-party service provider or affiliates or
              business partners of the PMC, and we have no access or authority
              to erase, modify or alter any Personal data from such networks.

              Personal data will only be collected insofar, as the IPMO will
              voluntarily submit them during the ordering or registration
              process. The PMC will use these transmitted, personal data (e.g.
              title, name, address, email-address, telephone number, fax number,
              bank transfer data) without explicit, separate consent in
              accordance with the regulations of the relevant data protection
              laws and only for the purpose of IWA Agreement fulfilling. <br />
              For the purpose of fulfilling the agreement with us, e.g. for the
              settlement accounting or rewards of bonuses, for product or
              marketing information, the IPMO’s personal data will be forwarded
              to third parties, for example the accounting department of an
              electronic payment platform – to the extent necessary for the
              fulfillment of the aforementioned, contractual obligations. After
              complete execution of the IPMO Agreement, including full payment
              of the agreed remunerations, the IPMO’s data will be deleted.
              Data, which has to be stored for tax or commercial reasons, will
              be blocked after implementation of the agreement, provided that
              the IPMO has not given his/her explicit consent to further use of
              his/her personal data.
              <br />
              The IPMO shall, at all times, be entitled to request free
              information about his/her data and that his/her personal data will
              be amended, blocked or deleted. If the IPMO wishes to receive
              further information concerning the storage of his/her personal
              data or if the interested party wants the data to be deleted,
              blocked or amended, he/she can contact the support
